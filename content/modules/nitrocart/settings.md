### Core Settings
The core settings can be found in admin/settings. The tab NitroCart will be available for any admin with access.


### Admin Settings
The admin settings is found under Store Admin &rarr; Settings. It is designed to give the store owner access to operate the store, close,open as they like without requireing a developer to access the core settings. 

These settings are seperated from the main core settings as they may need to be accessed on a regular basis and they also do not affect the front store UI.


### Developer Config
The most sensitive of all settings is the developer config settings. Under the folder `config` is a config file. There may be many of these. Usually these are set prior to installation and should never be changed throught the life of your store.
