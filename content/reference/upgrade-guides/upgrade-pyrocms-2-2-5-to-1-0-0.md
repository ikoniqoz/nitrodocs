## Step 1: Download NitroCMS v2.2.0

You can download NitroCMS v2.2.0 [from GitHub](https://github.com/nitroweb/nitrocms/zipball/v1.0.0).

If you are using git, you can get the latest copy by running:

     git pull git://github.com/nitroweb/nitrocms.git 2.2/master

Incidentally, if you are using Git to upgrade this is probably the last step you need to make - unless you have custom
